# Rubiks-Cube
A JavaFX project to make a Rubik's Cube. At the moment it simply plays
back a hardcoded algorithm, but I am hoping to eventually turn this into
a JavaFX library so that others making cube-related projects may benefit.
## Supported cubes
At the moment, the only one implemented is the 3x3x3, but if this does get
more attention somehow I will consider extending to other twisty puzzles.
